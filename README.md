# InstaLunchline

InstaLunchline is a fork of the [Lunchline app](https://github.com/teamwolverine/lunchline), completely refactored into Ionic for a mobile-first experience.  

InstaLunchline is a crowdsourced, hybird web/mobile app that lets users quickly search for restaurants around them and see what the wait times are to get their favorite food.
